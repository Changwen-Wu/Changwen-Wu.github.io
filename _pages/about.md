About me
======
I am a third-year master's student at the Institute for Brain Research and Rehabilitation, South China Normal University. My research interests focus on using multimodal neuroimaging techniques and graph-theoretical methods to model brain structure and function.

Under the supervision Prof. [Jinhui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4_djMV0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), I am working on network analysis using multimodal MRI imaging (fMRI/DWI/sMRI/ASL).
